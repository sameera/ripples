⛔ DEPRECATED AGENT

This agent (`nxs-council-architect`) has been superseded by `nxs-architect`, which includes:

- Standards conformance checking
- Testing strategy guidance
- Operational complexity analysis
- Flexible output formatting

**Action required**: Update your invocation to use `nxs-architect` instead.

If you reached this via `nxs.council`, the council command needs updating to reference the correct agent.
