<!--
CLOSE RECORD TEMPLATE — replaces PIR.md.

WHAT THIS IS
    The epic close artifact emitted by /nxs.close into the committed planning
    queue (.nexus/queue/epic-<epic-issue-number>/). It is HUMAN PROSE ONLY.

    There is NO ConceptDelta block (0006). The machine-handoff half is removed:
    System A emits nothing structured. The distiller mines THIS prose for the
    "why" it cannot derive from the code diff; B constructs the ConceptDeltas
    itself post-merge. Durability is structural — this entry is committed and
    travels to main with the PR; the distiller deletes it on consume.

CLOSE-FROM-DIFF FORCING FUNCTION
    /nxs.close diffs the branch AGAINST the decision record, auto-derives the
    "what" from the diff, and surfaces the detected DEVIATIONS. The human
    supplies rationale ONLY on those deviations (targeted, not a blank "write a
    summary"). That rationale lands in "Deviation Rationale" below.

RANGE STAMPING (unconditional — every mode)
    The range records the exact diff /nxs.close derived: git diff <base>...<head>
    in the named repo reproduces the epic's landed change. It is a LIST (one
    entry per touched repo); a single-code-repo epic populates exactly one.
    Full SHAs only — symbolic refs stop resolving once the branch is deleted.
    After a workspace migration this range is the only thing the hub-side
    drain can recompute the diff from.

FILLING RULES
    - Replace every {{PLACEHOLDER}}. Delete guidance comments before committing.
    - Deferred scope is FILED as backlog stub issues after the close checkpoint
      (C2); this record carries only their issue numbers, not the scope itself.
    - The process lesson is written as its own file under docs/delivery/lessons/
      (C3); this record does not restate it.

## Key Decisions

<!-- Decisions made or changed during implementation — especially any not
     captured in the decision record. Each: the decision + the why, and the
     refuted viable alternative if one existed (C1/G2 guardrail: no strawmen).
     This is the distiller's "why" source for the Decision Log. -->

- {{DECISION_AND_WHY}}

## Deviation Rationale

<!-- The output of the close-from-diff forcing function: for EACH deviation the
     diff showed against the decision record, why it happened. Only deviations
     go here — matched work needs no entry. -->

- **{{DEVIATION}}:** {{WHY_IT_DEVIATED}}

## Deferred Scope

<!-- Issue numbers only. The scope itself lives on the stub issues, which are
     filed in Phase 7.4 — after the checkpoint, before this record is committed.
     Write "none" when nothing was deferred. -->

Deferred items filed as backlog stub issues:

- #{{STUB_ISSUE}} — {{DEFERRED_GOAL}}

## Process Lesson

<!-- Pointer only. The lesson is its own file. -->
